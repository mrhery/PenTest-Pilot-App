PenTest Pilot App is simple app to do few basic of pentest or hacking stuff. In this app we implements 5 basic step/method of hacking such as Port Scanner (TCP), DNS Lookup, DNS Enum, Directory Buster, DoS Attack (L4/L7) and SMTP Mail client.

All the source codes is officially OpenSource pinned with GPLv3. Few of hacking/recon method are taken other tools logic code such as the the DoS attack we took few codes from LOIC repositories.

# Why PenTest Pilot?
Most of the hacking tools in mobile is hard to install and most of them are requiring rooted device. And not to mention that users will requires lot of command line to run, deploy and so on. Since the Termux has moved to FDroid packages and not supported in all devices, so we decided to build an app that user-friendly to use and requires not command line interface. They just install it then use it directly.
